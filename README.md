# f1 2021 telemetry data

Simple demo that levereges the @racehub-io/f1-telemetry-client package to capture and display telemetry data for F1 2021
<br />
This is supposed to be a free alternative to DashPanel for only F1 2021 but it still has some major features missing.
<br />
This uses the normal F1 wheel layout to map telemetry data.
